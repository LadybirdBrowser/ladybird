<!--
    This should just show in one full fragment in a TextNode.
    Before, when the font 'lololol' was not found, the default emoji font was picked for rendering.
    The text was split into five separate fragments.

    NOTE:
     - this may fail CI on Apple (the default font metrics may be different).
     - the layout metrics reported by `headless-browser -R` vs. `headless-browser -d` are different.

Well hello friends!
