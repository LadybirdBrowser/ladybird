Fail	Playback rate affects whether active phase boundary is inclusive.
Pass	Verify that (play -> pause -> play) doesn't change phase/progress.
Pass	Pause in before phase, scroll timeline into active phase, animation should remain in the before phase
Pass	Pause in before phase, set animation current time to be in active range, animation should become active. Scrolling should have no effect.
Pass	Make scroller inactive, then set current time to an in range time
Pass	Animation effect is still applied after pausing and making timeline inactive.
Pass	Make timeline inactive, force style update then pause the animation. No crashing indicates test success.
