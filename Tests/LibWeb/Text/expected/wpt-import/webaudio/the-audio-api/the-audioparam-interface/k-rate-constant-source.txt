Pass	> [ConstantSource k-rate offset] 
Pass	  k-rate offset: Setting offset.automationRate to "k-rate" is equal to k-rate.
Pass	  k-rate offset: k-rate node: offset.setValueAtTime(0,0) did not throw an exception.
Pass	  k-rate offset: k-rate node: offset.linearRampToValueAtTime(10,0.064) did not throw an exception.
Pass	  k-rate offset: a-rate node:offset.setValueAtTime(0,0) did not throw an exception.
Pass	  k-rate offset: a-rate node:offset.linearRampToValueAtTime(10,0.064) did not throw an exception.
Pass	  k-rate offset: Output of k-rate ConstantSourceNode is identical to the array [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0...].
Pass	  k-rate offset: Output of a-rate ConstantSourceNode is identical to the array [0,0.01953125,0.0390625,0.05859375,0.078125,0.09765625,0.1171875,0.13671875,0.15625,0.17578125,0.1953125,0.21484375,0.234375,0.25390625,0.2734375,0.29296875...].
