Result	Test Name	MessagePass	Aborting a WritableStream before it starts should cause the writer's unsettled ready promise to reject	
Pass	Aborting a WritableStream should cause the writer's fulfilled ready promise to reset to a rejected one	
Pass	abort() on a released writer rejects	
Pass	Aborting a WritableStream immediately prevents future writes	
Pass	Aborting a WritableStream prevents further writes after any that are in progress	
Pass	Fulfillment value of writer.abort() call must be undefined even if the underlying sink returns a non-undefined value	
Pass	WritableStream if sink's abort throws, the promise returned by writer.abort() rejects	
Pass	WritableStream if sink's abort throws, the promise returned by multiple writer.abort()s is the same and rejects	
Pass	WritableStream if sink's abort throws, the promise returned by ws.abort() rejects	
Pass	WritableStream if sink's abort throws, for an abort performed during a write, the promise returned by ws.abort() rejects	
Pass	Aborting a WritableStream passes through the given reason	
Pass	Aborting a WritableStream puts it in an errored state with the error passed to abort()	
Pass	Aborting a WritableStream causes any outstanding write() promises to be rejected with the reason supplied	
Pass	Closing but then immediately aborting a WritableStream causes the stream to error	
Pass	Closing a WritableStream and aborting it while it closes causes the stream to ignore the abort attempt	
Pass	Aborting a WritableStream after it is closed is a no-op	
Pass	WritableStream should NOT call underlying sink's close if no abort is supplied (historical)	
Pass	returning a thenable from abort() should work	
Pass	.closed should not resolve before fulfilled write()	
Pass	.closed should not resolve before rejected write(); write() error should not overwrite abort() error	
Pass	writes should be satisfied in order when aborting	
Pass	writes should be satisfied in order after rejected write when aborting	
Pass	close() should reject with abort reason why abort() is first error	
Pass	underlying abort() should not be called until underlying write() completes	
Pass	underlying abort() should not be called if underlying close() has started	
Pass	if underlying close() has started and then rejects, the abort() and close() promises should reject with the underlying close rejection reason	
Pass	an abort() that happens during a write() should trigger the underlying abort() even with a close() queued	
Pass	if a writer is created for a stream with a pending abort, its ready should be rejected with the abort error	
Pass	writer close() promise should resolve before abort() promise	
Pass	writer.ready should reject on controller error without waiting for underlying write	
Pass	writer.abort() while there is an in-flight write, and then finish the write with rejection	
Pass	writer.abort(), controller.error() while there is an in-flight write, and then finish the write	
Pass	writer.abort(), controller.error() while there is an in-flight close, and then finish the close	
Pass	controller.error(), writer.abort() while there is an in-flight write, and then finish the write	
Pass	controller.error(), writer.abort() while there is an in-flight close, and then finish the close	
Pass	releaseLock() while aborting should reject the original closed promise	
Pass	releaseLock() during delayed async abort() should reject the writer.closed promise	
Pass	sink abort() should not be called until sink start() is done	
Pass	if start attempts to error the controller after abort() has been called, then it should lose	
Pass	stream abort() promise should still resolve if sink start() rejects	
Pass	writer abort() during sink start() should replace the writer.ready promise synchronously	
Pass	promises returned from other writer methods should be rejected when writer abort() happens during sink start()	
Pass	abort() should succeed despite rejection from write	
Pass	abort() should be rejected with the rejection returned from close()	
Pass	a rejecting sink.write() should not prevent sink.abort() from being called	
Pass	when start errors after stream abort(), underlying sink abort() should be called anyway	
Pass	when calling abort() twice on the same stream, both should give the same promise that fulfills with undefined	
Pass	when calling abort() twice on the same stream, but sequentially so so there's no pending abort the second time, both should fulfill with undefined	
Pass	calling abort() on an errored stream should fulfill with undefined	
Pass	sink abort() should not be called if stream was erroring due to controller.error() before abort() was called	
Pass	sink abort() should not be called if stream was erroring due to bad strategy before abort() was called	
Pass	abort with no arguments should set the stored error to undefined	
Pass	abort with an undefined argument should set the stored error to undefined	
Pass	abort with a string argument should set the stored error to that argument	
Pass	abort on a locked stream should reject	
Pass	WritableStreamDefaultController.signal	
Pass	the abort signal is signalled synchronously - write	
Pass	the abort signal is signalled synchronously - close	
Pass	the abort signal is not signalled on error	
Pass	the abort signal is not signalled on write failure	
Pass	the abort signal is not signalled on close failure	
Pass	recursive abort() call
