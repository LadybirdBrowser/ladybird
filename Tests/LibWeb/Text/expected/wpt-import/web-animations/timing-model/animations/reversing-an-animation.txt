Pass	Reversing an animation inverts the playback rate
Pass	Reversing an animation plays a pausing animation
Pass	Reversing an animation maintains the same current time
Pass	Reversing an animation does not cause it to leave the pending state
Pass	Reversing an animation does not cause it to resolve the ready promise
Pass	Reversing an animation when playbackRate > 0 and currentTime > effect end should make it play from the end
Pass	Reversing an animation when playbackRate > 0 and currentTime < 0 should make it play from the end
Pass	Reversing an animation when playbackRate < 0 and currentTime < 0 should make it play from the start
Pass	Reversing an animation when playbackRate < 0 and currentTime > effect end should make it play from the start
Pass	Reversing an animation when playbackRate > 0 and currentTime < 0 and the target effect end is positive infinity should throw an exception
Pass	When reversing throws an exception, the playback rate remains unchanged
Pass	Reversing animation when playbackRate = 0 and currentTime < 0 and the target effect end is positive infinity should NOT throw an exception
Pass	Reversing an animation when playbackRate < 0 and currentTime < 0 and the target effect end is positive infinity should make it play from the start
Fail	Reversing when when playbackRate == 0 should preserve the current time and playback rate
Pass	Reversing an idle animation from starts playing the animation
Fail	Reversing an animation without an active timeline throws an InvalidStateError
Pass	Reversing should use the negative pending playback rate
Pass	When reversing fails, it should restore any previous pending playback rate
