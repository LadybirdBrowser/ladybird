# Frequently Asked Questions about Ladybird

## Will Ladybird support `$THING`?

Eventually, probably, if there's a Web Spec for it!

## When will you implement `$THING`?

Maybe someday. Maybe never. If you want to see something happen, you can do it yourself!

## Well, how do I run this thing then?

Simple, my friend! Just refer to the [build instructions](BuildInstructionsLadybird.md).

## I did a `git pull` and now the build is broken! What do I do?

If it builds on CI, it should build for you too. You may need to rebuild the toolchain. If that doesn't help, try it with a clean repo.

If you can't figure out what to do, ask in the `#help-build-problems` channel on Slack.
