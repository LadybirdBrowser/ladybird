# Contributing to Ladybird

When contributing to Ladybird, make sure that the changes you wish to make are in line with the project direction. If you are not sure about this, open an issue first, so we can discuss it.

**For your first couple of PRs, start with something small to get familiar with the project and its development processes. Please do not start by adding a large component.**

Everyone is welcome to work on the project, and while we have lots of fun, it's a serious kind of fun. :^)

## Communication

Join [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/nvfjVJ4Svh) to participate in development discussion.

## Issue policy

Please file any bugs you find, keeping the following in mind:

* One issue per bug. Putting multiple things in the same issue makes both discussion and completion unnecessarily complicated.
* Follow the [detailed issue-reporting guidelines](ISSUES.md).
* No build issues (or other support requests). If the GitHub Actions CI build succeeds, the build problem is most likely on your side. Work it out locally, or ask in the `#build-problems` channel on Discord.
* Don't comment on issues just to add a joke or irrelevant commentary. Hundreds of people get notified about comments so let's keep them relevant.

## Project governance

The Ladybird project is driven by the [Ladybird Browser Initiative](https://ladybird.org/), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.

Pull requests are approved and merged by a group of maintainers. The current group of maintainers are (in alphabetical order):

- [Ali Mohammad Pur (@alimpfard)](https://github.com/alimpfard)
- [Aliaksandr Kalenik (@kalenikaliaksandr)](https://github.com/kalenikaliaksandr)
- [Andreas Kling (@awesomekling)](https://github.com/awesomekling)
- [Andrew Kaster (@ADKaster)](https://github.com/ADKaster)

## Human language policy

In Ladybird, we treat human language as seriously as we do programming language.

The following applies to all user-facing strings, code, comments, and commit messages:

* The official project language is American English with ISO 8601 dates and metric units.
* Use proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation.
* Write in an authoritative and technical tone.
* Avoid contractions, slang, and idioms.
* Avoid humor, sarcasm, and other forms of non-literal language.
* Use gender-neutral pronouns, except when referring to a specific person.

Note that this also applies to debug logging and other internal strings, as they may be exposed to users in the future.

## Testing policy

When possible, please include tests when fixing bugs or adding new features.

## Code submission policy

Nobody is perfect, and sometimes we mess things up. That said, here are some good do's & don'ts to try and stick to:

**Do:**

* Write in idiomatic project-style C++23, using the `AK` containers in all code.
* Conform to the project coding style found in [CodingStyle.md](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/blob/master/Documentation/CodingStyle.md). Use `clang-format` (version 18 or later) to automatically format C++ files. See [AdvancedBuildInstructions.md](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/blob/master/Documentation/AdvancedBuildInstructions.md#clang-format-updates) for instructions on how to get an up-to-date version if your OS distribution does not ship clang-format-18.
* Choose expressive variable, function and class names. Make it as obvious as possible what the code is doing.
* Split your changes into separate, atomic commits (i.e. A commit per feature or fix, where the build, tests and the system are all functioning).
* Make sure your commits are rebased on the master branch.
* Wrap your commit messages at 72 characters.
* The first line of the commit message is the subject line, and must have the format "Category: Brief description of what's being changed". The category should be the name of a library, application, service, utility, etc.
  * Examples: `LibMedia`, `WebContent`, `CI`, `AK`, `RequestServer`, `js`
  * Don't use a category like "`Userland`" or "`Utilities`", except for generic changes that affect a large portion of code within these directories.
  * Don't use specific component names, e.g. C++ class names, as the category either - mention them in the summary instead. E.g. `LibGUI: Brief description of what's being changed in FooWidget` rather than `FooWidget: Brief description of what's being changed`
  * Several categories may be combined with `+`, e.g. `LibJS+LibWeb+Browser: ...`
* Write the commit message subject line in the imperative mood ("Foo: Change the way dates work", not "Foo: Changed the way dates work").
* Write your commit messages in proper English, with care and punctuation.
* Amend your existing commits when adding changes after a review, where relevant.
* Mark each review comment as "resolved" after pushing a fix with the requested changes.
* Add your personal copyright line to files when making substantive changes. (Optional but encouraged!)
* Check the spelling of your code, comments and commit messages.
* If you have images that go along with your code, run `optipng -strip all` on them to optimize and strip away useless metadata - this can reduce file size from multiple kilobytes to a couple hundred bytes.

**Don't:**

* Submit code that's incompatible with the project licence (2-clause BSD.)
* Touch anything outside the stated scope of the PR.
* Iterate excessively on your design across multiple commits.
* Use weasel-words like "refactor" or "fix" to avoid explaining what's being changed.
* End commit message subject lines with a period.
* Include commented-out code.
* Write in C. (Instead, take advantage of C++'s amenities, and don't limit yourself to the standard C library.)
* Attempt large architectural changes until you are familiar with the system and have worked on it for a while.
* Engage in excessive "feng shui programming" by moving code around without quantifiable benefit.
* Add jokes or other "funny" things to user-facing parts of the system.

## Pull Request Q&A

### I've submitted a PR and it passes CI. When can I expect to get some review feedback?

While unadvertised PRs may get randomly merged by curious maintainers, you will have a much smoother time if you engage with the community on Discord.

### If my PR isn't getting attention, how long should I wait before pinging one of the project maintainers?

Ping them right away if it's something urgent! If it's less urgent, advertise your PR on Discord (`#code-review`) and ask if someone could review it.

### Is there a policy for branches/PRs that haven't been touched in X days? Should they be closed?

Yes, we have a "stalebot" that will mark untouched PRs as "stale" after 21 days, and close them after another 7 days if nothing happens.

### Are there specific people to reach out to for different subsystems (e.g. Networking, GUI, CSS, etc)?

In theory, the best person to speak with is whoever wrote most code adjacent to what you're working on. In practice, asking in one of the development channels on Discord is usually easier/better, since that allows many people to join the discussion.

### Is Discord the place to ask for review help, or is GitHub preferred?

It's definitely better to ask on Discord. Due to the volume of GitHub notifications, many of us turn them off and rely on Discord for learning about review requests.

## Commit Hooks

The repository contains a file called `.pre-commit-config.yaml` that defines several 'commit hooks' that can be run automatically just before and after creating a new commit. These hooks lint your commit message, and the changes it contains to ensure they will pass the automated CI for pull requests.
To enable these hooks firstly follow the installation instructions available at https://pre-commit.com/#install and then enable one or both of the following hooks:
 - pre-commit hook - Runs Meta/lint-ci.sh and Meta/lint-ports.py to ensure changes to the code will pass linting:
   ```console
   pre-commit install
   ```
 - post-commit hook - Lints the commit message to ensure it will pass the commit linting:
   ```console
   pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
   ```

## Git Notes

The GitHub project contains [git notes](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-notes) for each commit that includes e.g. a link to
the pull request from which the commit originated and reviewer information. These are updated automatically, but require
an additional step locally to be able to see the notes in `git log`:

```bash
git config --add remote.upstream.fetch '+refs/notes/*:refs/notes/*'
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `upstream` remote in this command should be replaced with whatever you've named the LadybirdBrowser/ladybird.git
> remote in your local clone. Use `git remote -v` to find that name.

Now, any time you `git fetch`, the latest notes will be fetched as well. You will see information like the following when
you run `git log`:

```

## On abandoned pull requests

Sometimes good PRs get abandoned by the author for one reason or another. If the PR is fundamentally good, but the author is not responding to requests, the PR may be manually integrated with minor changes to code and commit messages.

To make this easier, we do appreciate it if folks enable the "Allow edits from maintainers" flag on their pull requests.

## On neutrality

Our goal is to build a browser for everyone, irrespective of their specific opinions and worldviews.
To achieve this, we strive to set our differences aside and focus on the shared goal of building the browser.

This means:
- We welcome contributions from anyone who is committed to the project's goals and respects the collaborative environment.
- Our discussions and work will remain strictly related to browser development and web standards. We do not take positions on issues outside this scope.
- The project will not be used as a platform to advertise or promote causes unrelated to browser development or web standards.
- To maintain a focused and productive environment, discussions on societal politics and other divisive topics are discouraged in project spaces.

We encourage everyone to share their personal views and opinions outside project spaces. However, please keep project spaces focused on project goals.

## On bad-faith contributions and brigading

We reserve the right to reject issues and pull requests that appear to be motivated by bad faith.

Additionally, anyone found participating in social media brigading of Ladybird will be permanently banned from the project.
