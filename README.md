# Ladybird

[Ladybird](https://ladybird.org) is a truly independent web browser, using a novel engine based on web standards.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ladybird is in a pre-alpha state, and only suitable for use by developers

## Features

We aim to build a complete and usable browser for the modern web.

Ladybird uses a multi-process architecture with a main UI process, several WebContent renderer processes,
an ImageDecoder process, and a RequestServer process.

Image decoding and network connections are done out of process to be more robust against malicious content.
Each tab has its own renderer process, which is sandboxed from the rest of the system.

At the moment, many core library support components are inherited from SerenityOS:

- LibWeb: Web rendering engine
- LibJS: JavaScript engine
- LibWasm: WebAssembly implementation
- LibCrypto/LibTLS: Cryptography primitives and Transport Layer Security
- LibHTTP: HTTP/1.1 client
- LibGfx: 2D Graphics Library, Image Decoding and Rendering
- LibUnicode: Unicode and locale support
- LibMedia: Audio and video playback
- LibCore: Event loop, OS abstraction layer
- LibIPC: Inter-process communication

## How do I build and run this?

See the [build instructions](Documentation/BuildInstructionsLadybird.md) for information on how to get Ladybird running on your system.

Ladybird runs on Linux, macOS, Windows (with WSL2), and many other \*Nixes.

## How do I read the documentation?

Code-related documentation can be found in the [Documentation](Documentation/) folder.
